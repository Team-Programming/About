# About
An open source programming space for teams to build, learn and collaborate on code, skills and technologies.

# Focus
The focus is on introducing and building up brand new/junior developers looking to improve their teamwork, leadership, collaboration and programming skills through small team simple projects.  Experienced developers are welcome as well but please don't scare off those who are new.

# Inclusion
Joining the organization is open to anyone with an interest in software programming/coding or learning how to start as well as anyone willing to mentor those who are in their early stages of learning.

# Learning
Our organization is filled with repositories that help the absolute beginner with the most basic of concepts as well as advanced guides for those willing to learn more.

# Structure
The organization has a decentralized model consisting of small teams of with a maximum number of five team members.  
- Each team consists of one team leader and up to four team members
- Teams may combine but they must keep a 4:1 ratio.
    - For example: Three teams can combine on a project each with their own team leader and members but there needs to be one higher team leader to oversee the three team leaders
    - This keeps teams small enough to be personal and manageable

# Ground Rules
1. First and foremost, this is a place to learn and grow.  Treat others better than you treat most and give them space to make mistakes and grow.
2. This is a mentoring space.  If somebody doesn't know something that you do, it is your responsibility to be patient and understanding and teach them.
    - Teaching not only helps the other person but it actually improves your understanding.
    - If you can't teach it, then you don't know it well enough and should go learn it some more on your own and then teach it.
3. Everyone is equal. No one person is greater than the other and everyone should be treated with kindness, gentleness and respect.
4. This is a collaborative environment, no hate speech, threats or trolling. If you don't like what someone thinks or believes, be respectful and agree to disagree.
5. A team can be no larger than 4 people with 1 team leader. Collaborative teams can have multiple teams within it but there can never be more than a 4:1 ratio of members to leader.
6. The team leader has the final say in all matters regarding the code. If you don't like the team leader's decision then you have the option to leave or form your own team.
7. This is a first come first serve leadership structure (i.e. the first person to start the project is the leader and the members fill in from there).
8. A change in leadership can only be instituted by the leader or those above them.
9. If there is a leadership conflict and a leader wont step down, you have the freedom to copy the code and start the project on your own.
10. All the code is open source and able to be copied, modified, changed or used in any circumstance or situation. You waive all rights to copyright and intellectual property.
11. You can only be a team leader of 5 baseline teams at a time and that number decreases with each level of team you add.
12. As projects get large enough, additional roles can be added: Project Manager, Technology Manager, Onboarding Manager, Financial Manager
13. Projects that turn into a business can be taken down at anytime from the project board.

# Members
Anyone can join, you can come and go as you please.  There are no commitments are requirements to participate, stay or even stay on a specific team.  If you don't like a team or a project, you are able to switch or leave but do so in a respectful and helpful manner.  This is a space for everyone to try and learn to improve themselves and others

# Conflict
Let's make peace.  It is better to be right and leave peacefully than it is to fight and try to force a change.  Humility is the key.  Humbly raise your concerns and if they are willing to receive it, that is a good thing.  If not, it may be time to switch teams.

# Team Leaders
You are the humble servant who is to gently direct, guide, build up and encourage your team. You arenâ€™t the dictator but you do have the final say. If you are encouraging and caring for those you are leading, they will very likely **want** to follow your decisions. 

Be humble but provide a way, a vision and helpful steps to complete it. 

Take care of your team members, get to know them, their skills, strengths, weaknesses, home life, abilities and way of thinking. It will benefit you and them so much in the long run. Remember, these are **all** skills that will greatly benefit you in the future no matter what company, technology stack, industry or even job you have.  Leadership skills and people skills are needed everywhere.
