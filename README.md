# About
Team Programming is an open source project space for brand new/junior developers looking to start learning, improve their skills and learn leadership.  Experienced developers are welcome as well.

# Inclusion
Joining the organization is open to anyone with an interest in software programming/coding or learning how to start.  

# Learning
Our organization is filled with repositories that help the absolute beginner with the most basic of concepts as well as advanced guides for those willing to learn more.

# Structure
The organization has a decentralized model consisting of small teams of with a maximum number of five team members.  
- Each team consists of one team leader and up to four team members
- Teams may combine but they must keep a 4:1 ratio.
    - For example: Three teams can combine on a project each with their own team leader and members but there needs to be one higher team leader to oversee the three team leaders
    - This keeps teams small enough to be personal and manageable
